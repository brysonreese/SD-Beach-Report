# SD Beach Report

A native iOS app for checking real-time water quality and advisory status at beaches across San Diego County.

## Overview

SD Beach Report pulls live data from the San Diego County Department of Environmental Health and Quality (DEH) Beach and Bay Program and presents it in a clean, easy to read format. Quickly see which beaches are open, under advisory, or closed before you head out.

## Features

- **Live beach status** — fetches current water quality reports from the DEH on launch with pull to refresh
- **Status indicators** — beaches are color coded by status (Closed, Advisory, Open) with clear iconography
- **Favorites** — swipe right on any beach to favorite it, with persistent storage and drag to reorder
- **Detail view** — tap any beach to see full description, advisory, and closure information with HTML rendered properly
- **Full beach list** — searchable and sortable list of all monitored San Diego beaches
- **Interactive map** — all beach locations plotted on a map with color coded pins, tap a pin or select from the sheet list to view details

## Data Source

Beach water quality data is sourced from the San Diego County DEH Beach and Bay Program. All monitoring data, sampling results, and water quality assessments are their work — this app simply presents it in a convenient format.

## Requirements

- iOS 26+
- Xcode 26+
- Internet connection for live data
